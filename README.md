# Tetris-AI

### Background:
Genetic Algorithms are a type of evolutionary algorithm which use the basic principles from Darwin's theory of evolution to achieve parameter optimization. The goal of this project was to succesfully implement a genetic algorithm, that learns to play Tetris and achieve high scores.

### Documentation:
To create the application the SFML library was used along with the open GA framework in C++. For more tecnical information about the application, the documentation can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/StylianosZachariou/Tetris-AI/files/8456614/Documentation.pdf)

### The Application:
A zipped file containing the executable can be downloaded from the Release page or [here](https://github.com/StylianosZachariou/Tetris-AI/releases/download/1.0/executable.zip). The application consist of two windows:

- The console window, containing information for the current generation:

- The game window, showing the best player from the previous generation playing the game:

As the generations progress the algorithm will become better at playing the game and achieving higher score.
