# Tetris-AI

### Background:
Genetic Algorithms are a type of evolutionary algorithm which use the basic principles from Darwin's theory of evolution to achieve parameter optimization. The goal of this project was to succesfully implement a genetic algorithm, that learns to play Tetris and achieve high scores.

### Documentation:
To create the application the SFML library was used along with the open GA framework in C++. For more tecnical information about the application, the documentation can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/StylianosZachariou/Tetris-AI/files/8456614/Documentation.pdf)

### The Application:
